# Sample OpenAI GPT API Implementation with FastAPI

This project provides a sample implementation of the OpenAI GPT API using the FastAPI framework. It allows you to interact with the OpenAI GPT language model through a simple RESTful API.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following requirements installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip package manager

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/openai-gpt-api-sample.git```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```cd openai-gpt-api-sample```

3. Install the project dependencies using pip:
  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
  
## Configuration
1. Sign up for the OpenAI API and obtain an API key.

2. Create a .env file in the project root directory and add the following:
  ```OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key```
  Replace your-openai-api-key with your actual OpenAI API key.
  
## Usage
1. Start the FastAPI server:
  ```uvicorn app.main:app --reload```

2. The server will start running locally at http://localhost:8000.

3. Create a User. Send a POST request to http://localhost:8000/users with the following JSON payload:
  ```
  {
    "email": "sample@gmail.com",
    "password": "123"
  }
  ```
4. Login. Send a POST request to http://localhost:8000/login with the following JSON payload:
  ```
  {
    "email": "sample@gmail.com",
    "password": "123"
  }
  ```

3. Send a POST request to http://localhost:8000/completions with the following JSON payload:
  ```
  {
    "message": "Hello GPT"
  }
  ```
Note: You will need your Bearer Token
Replace the prompt value with your desired text prompt and adjust max_tokens as needed.

4.The server will respond with the completion generated by the OpenAI GPT model.
